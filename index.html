        <p> A drive to make and break led me to web development. The need for a perfect sandbox, one only limited by my imagination, made shifting to web development extremely appealing. Being able to potentially build anything just feels so empowering. Exploring the various modes of development is exciting and I'm eager to learn more and build more projects. </p>
        <p> Previously, I worked with very physical things, mainly klystrons that take forever to make and an eyewatering amount of money to build. Through this opportunity though, I explored the ins and outs of successful collaboration to make and test very very large physical things. I am very hopeful all this transfers well to managing codebases and working on large teams.</p>
        <p> I'm always looking for new ways to grow and for more interesting projects to tackle. Since I'm just starting out on my developer jouney, I'm open to learning new tools that best suit the project. Currently I'm building a strong base in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, but I want to look into C# for game development and Node.JS for Back-end.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to browse the following projects. I would love to hear any feedback you may have, or be part of future collaborations. I'm all ears for new ideas!</p>
