          <p> A drive to make and break led me to web development. The need for a perfect sandbox, one only limited by my imagination, made shifting to web development extremely appealing. Being able to potentially build anything is empowering. Exploring the various modes of development is exciting and I'm eager to learn more and build more projects. </p>
          <br>
          <p> I have a mechanical engineering background where I constantly identify key needs and collaborate with clients to define targets and execute them. Previously, I worked with very physical things, mainly klystrons that take forever to design and an eyewatering amount of money to build. Through this opportunity though, I explored the ins and outs of successful collaboration to make and test unbelievably large physical things. I am confident these skills transfer well to managing codebases and working on large teams.</p>
          <br>
          <p> I'm always looking for new ways to grow and for more interesting projects to tackle. I'm a firm believer in constantly learning to improve yourself, and I'm open to learning new tools that best suit the project. Currently I'm strengthening the concepts fundamental to using React and Express most efficiently, but I want to look into C# for Unity in the future.</p>
